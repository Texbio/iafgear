## Updated version of iafgear to 1.20.1

Original can be found: https://github.com/Partonetrain/iafgear

I used Claude code to help me with the update (ai).

Currently there are no changes, but if there are changes they will be listed here

- (may add dreadsteel + textures / other materials that are in new ice and fire versions)
- (Maybe fix the silent gear outcomes? silent dragonsteel helm is weaker than normal dragonsteel helm)

## Example Textures (edited by Partonetrain in his original github):
